              Music connects. Over time, over distance. It can transcend death
              and bring disparate peoples together. Community within music has a
              way of ekeing at something visceral within us, where rythm and
              emotion bind us and words falter to describe the depth of what is
              being felt.

              Global pandemics make the collective effervescence of a concert
              near impossible. That shouldn't stop us from connecting.

              Those shared musical moments are among my deepest and most
              profound experiences. The goal of this project is to give others a
              space to find that too.
