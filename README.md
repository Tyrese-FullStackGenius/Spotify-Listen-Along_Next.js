# LSTN ALNG - Music should be shared.

Listen Along is bringing back listening rooms. Intimate opportunities to share and experience music with your friends. A shared queue can be added to and edited by anyone present in the listening room. Vote songs up the queue and jam synchronously together via Spotify—-even when you can't be together.

## Setting up

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You will need to register your own Spotify app and set the credentials in a couple of config files. For that:

1. Create an application on [Spotify's Developer Site](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/)

2. Add both http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (for development) and <production_domain>/auth/callback (if you want to deploy your app somewhere) as redirect uris

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables;

   - `HOST`
   - `CLIENT_ID`
   - `CLIENT_SECRET`

Example:

```
HOST=http://localhost:3000
CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>
```

## Dependencies

Install the dependencies running `npm install`.

## Running
